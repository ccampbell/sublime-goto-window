# Sublime Goto Window

This package allows you to change between open windows in Sublime Text using a
prompt. It is useful if you have a lot of windows open with different projects
in them and you want to switch without having to press `command ~` over and over again.

## To Install

If you are using Sublime Package Control you can press ``command+shift+p``.  Then select ``Package Control: Install Package`` and choose ``GotoWindow``.

Another option is running the following command (this is the OS X version):

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
git clone git@github.com:ccampbell/sublime-goto-window.git GotoWindow
```

### Linux dependencies

This plugin depends on `wmctrl` being installed on your system. On Debian-based
operating systems (such as Ubuntu), you can get it using `apt-get install wmctrl`.

## Usage

The default keybinding is

```
super + shift + o
```

After that you will see a menu that looks like this containing all your open
windows in Sublime Text:

Select an item and that's it!

## Note

There is a bug that prevents this from actually working natively using Sublime
Text APIs. See https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/444 for more
information.

I haven't been able to test it on Windows, but there are workarounds in place
that seem to work on OS X and Linux.
